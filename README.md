Hi There!

First, Thank you if you starred any of my projects, I am really appericate your star, and I would even more appericate if you star any projects in the main page!

Second, Thank you if you follow me, and I will be very appericiate if you star my projects if you havent already!

If you find my projects interesting, plz consider starring. And this is the last time I ask you for this. These projects exist for the sole purpose of getting me a jobs in a EU / US, which is very hard for a people from a third world country like me. Since I have to learn everything from scratch, these projects have taken years of my life to do. So I need as much star as possible. 

When you come from a third world country and want to find a job in the first world country, you are at a huge disavantage that you have to prove that you are better than the people from the first world country, who also have top notch university to study. In my country, university degree is so bad that local company don't even care if you have one or not, even if the degree belong to one of the best university!

Actually I can easily find a high paying job in my country, but there is just no future staying in my country. I have to say that my country is a communist mafia state, similar to China and Russia now. So I have to fought hard to make these kind of projects. And graphics programming literally not exist in my country, so if I failed to get a job in EU/US, then all those hard work will come in vain!

Not to mention, everyone, family members always mock me as a jobless, and have no future. I have intense fighting with parents once a month, it really stressful. They said why don't just accept the fact and find a job, start a family. I said, well, I will do so, but not in this shit hole country. I am only in my 20s and in term of knowledge, I am far ahead than a lot of people in my age and older, I just happen to be poor and they see me as a total losers (thet are obviously losers here!).

So plz, consider starring, the reason I don't update regularly because there are so few stars and it so frustating. I need more stars for my up coming interviews. 

The current state of my projects are just so pathetic!

why so many medicore projects have hundred and thousand of stars!

why so many projects just do the same thing as I did get hundred of stars!

And you have to substract stars from my friends, who don't even care about graphics. The real stars count is actually very small!

Consider starring now because this will be the last time I will ever ask for this. when the interview happend in early to mid june, 1 millions star won't make any different any more, your star will be game changing now, but after june it will be worthless!

And if I just failed and have to surrender to my fate, then, fine. At best I will not posting any more, worst I will erase everything. I see many people use my code for reference in their projects but don't bother to star anything! if any one of that people read that message then remember that it will not exist in github forever!

You may say: "Your projects is really trivial, there are many way better ones!", well, may be. But consider this, take wicked engine by janos turanszky for example. I admire his talent and his works are wonderful. But can you learn from his code? It is a massive project for sure, but what can you learn from it. The best thing you can do is download and run the code. That's why he is so confident putting everything up there, because he know it is too complex that you can not learn anything from it!

the same with pbrt3 and pbrt4, it was create for profession or some one who already know how to write a graphics renderer!, not learning from front to back.

LuxRender and my code are not really big, but at least simple enough to learn!

It not that I can not do it better, I can add bdpt, mlt and compress wide bvh, and better material, and way more advance features, it really not that hard! But many people just want free code and no star, then they will get nothing at all! And why I have to sacrifice my free time just to get nothing in return!

Everyday, I wake up without any star, I feel like a loser stuck in a conner!

And this will be the last time I ever ask for this!

So, plz starring now. It took me years of hard work to do these projects, and you can download it for free, you only have to star, why is it so hard!

There will be 3 more new projects coming this month, consider starring them as well, they really need your support!

Thank you again for starring and following me!
